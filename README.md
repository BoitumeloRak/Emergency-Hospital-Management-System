🏥 Hospital Emergency Coordination System (HECS)A real-time, distributed microservices ecosystem designed to synchronize hospital departments during critical patient intake. This system uses Java (Javalin), Apache ActiveMQ, and Thymeleaf to provide "Situational Awareness" to medical staff.🌟 The Problem & SolutionIn busy South African hospitals, communication delays between Triage (the front door) and the ICU/Wards (the resources) can be life-threatening.HECS bridges this gap by using a Message Broker to broadcast patient status instantly. When a nurse admits a patient, the information is "pushed" to dashboards across the hospital—no phone calls required.🏗 System ArchitectureThis project is a Maven Multi-Module system, ensuring that services remain "Loosely Coupled" (independent).common/: The Data Contract. Contains shared objects like TriageEvent and the HospitalMQ interface.triage-service/: The Producer. A REST-based service (Port 7001) where patients are admitted.resource-service/: The Consumer. A logic engine (Port 7002) that tracks available beds and equipment.web-dashboard/: The Live UI. A web-based "Mission Control" (Port 7070) that shows real-time patient alerts.📡 Messaging Logic (ActiveMQ)We use a Topic (Pub-Sub) model for the TRIAGE_TOPIC because multiple departments need to hear the same alert at the same time.Triage LevelPriorityAction Taken by System🔴 REDHigh (9)Immediate alert on Dashboard; reserves ICU bed.🟠 ORANGEUrgent (6)Flashing alert; notifies senior doctor.🟡 YELLOWRoutine (4)Added to waiting list.🟢 GREENLow (1)Logged for record-keeping.🚀 Installation & RunningPrerequisitesJava 17+ActiveMQ Classic (Running at tcp://localhost:61616)Maven 3.8+Quick Start (Build Script)We use a custom build script to ensure the Common Module is installed before the services start:Bashchmod +x run_hospital.sh
./run_hospital.sh
🛡️ Distributed Systems Theory AppliedTo demonstrate high-level engineering, this project implements the following concepts:Loose Coupling: If the Dashboard crashes, the Triage Service remains 100% functional. ActiveMQ stores the messages until the Dashboard recovers.Eventual Consistency: The Dashboard might reflect the triage state a few milliseconds after the database, which is acceptable for hospital coordination.Data Sovereignty: Each service manages its own internal state (e.g., the Resource Service alone knows the bed counts).Fault Tolerance: ActiveMQ's "Store and Forward" logic ensures that no patient alert is lost during brief network flickers.🧪 TestingREST Test: Send a POST to http://localhost:7001/triage with a JSON payload.MQ Test: Log into the ActiveMQ Console (http://localhost:8161) to see the TRIAGE_TOPIC traffic.UI Test: Watch the Dashboard at http://localhost:7070 update in real-time as patients are added.
